## Integration Guidelines

### How Components Work Together

1. **Main → AuthenticationService**: Handle login
2. **AuthenticationService → UserManager**: Retrieve user data
3. **Main → EnrollmentManager**: Student enrolls in course
4. **EnrollmentManager → CourseManager**: Check course availability
5. **EnrollmentManager → GradeManager**: Check prerequisites (past grades)
6. **EnrollmentManager → NotificationManager**: Send enrollment confirmation
7. **GradeManager → NotificationManager**: Notify grade posted
8. **ReportManager → All Managers**: Gather data for reports
9. **FileRepository → All Managers**: Load/save data

### Coordination Tips
- Use a **shared Google Doc** to track interface contracts
- **Meet regularly** to discuss integration points
- **Test components individually** before integration
- **Use Git branches** for features, merge to main when stable
- **Communicate via WhatsApp/Slack** for quick questions

## Testing Your Code

### Unit Testing (Manual)
Test each component individually before integration:

**Example: Testing Course Management**
```java
// Create a course
Course course = new Course("CS101", "Intro to Programming", 3, "prof1", 30);

// Test capacity check
System.out.println(course.isFull()); // Should print false

// Test adding students
for (int i = 0; i < 30; i++) {
    course.addStudent("student" + i);
}
System.out.println(course.isFull()); // Should print true
```

### Integration Testing
Test component interactions:

**Example: Enrollment Workflow**
```java
// 1. Student logs in
// 2. Views available courses
// 3. Enrolls in a course
// 4. Receives notification
// 5. Views updated enrollment list
```

## OOP Concepts Demonstrated

### 1. Inheritance
**Definition:** A mechanism where a new class inherits properties and behaviors from an existing class.

**Examples in Our Project:**
- `Student`, `Instructor`, `Admin` extend `User`
- `LetterGradeCalculator`, `PassFailCalculator` extend `GradeCalculator`
- `Transcript`, `CourseRoster` extend `Report`
- `EmailNotification`, `SMSNotification` extend `Notification`

**Code Example:**
```java
public class Student extends User {
    private double gpa;
    
    @Override
    public void displayInfo() {
        System.out.println("Student: " + getFullName());
        System.out.println("GPA: " + gpa);
    }
    
    @Override
    public String getRole() {
        return "STUDENT";
    }
}
```

---

### 2. Polymorphism
**Definition:** The ability of objects to take multiple forms. Same method name, different implementations.

**Examples in Our Project:**
- `displayInfo()` method behaves differently for Student, Instructor, Admin
- `send()` method works differently for Email, SMS, InApp notifications
- `calculateGrade()` varies by grading scheme

**Code Example:**
```java
User user1 = new Student(...);
User user2 = new Instructor(...);

user1.displayInfo(); // Calls Student's version
user2.displayInfo(); // Calls Instructor's version
```

---

### 3. Encapsulation
**Definition:** Bundling data and methods that operate on that data within a class, hiding internal details.

**Examples in Our Project:**
- All fields are `private` with `public` getters/setters
- Validation logic is hidden inside methods
- Course capacity checking is encapsulated in `isFull()` method

**Code Example:**
```java
public class Course {
    private int capacity; // Hidden from outside
    
    public void setCapacity(int capacity) {
        if (capacity > 0) { // Validation hidden here
            this.capacity = capacity;
        }
    }
    
    public boolean isFull() {
        return enrolledStudents.size() >= capacity;
    }
}
```

---

### 4. Abstraction
**Definition:** Hiding complex implementation details and showing only essential features.

**Examples in Our Project:**
- `EnrollmentService` interface hides enrollment complexity
- `DataRepository` interface hides storage mechanism
- Abstract classes (`User`, `Notification`, `Report`) define structure without implementation

**Code Example:**
```java
// Interface defines WHAT to do, not HOW
public interface EnrollmentService {
    Enrollment enrollStudent(String studentId, String courseCode, String semester);
}

// Implementation defines HOW
public class EnrollmentManager implements EnrollmentService {
    @Override
    public Enrollment enrollStudent(String studentId, String courseCode, String semester) {
        // Complex logic here
        // Check prerequisites, capacity, conflicts, etc.
    }
}
```

## Design Decisions

### Why We Used Interfaces
We used interfaces (`EnrollmentService`, `DataRepository`, `NotificationService`) to:
- Allow multiple implementations (e.g., could switch from file storage to database)
- Make code more testable
- Follow the principle of "program to an interface, not an implementation"

### Why We Used Abstract Classes
We used abstract classes (`User`, `Notification`, `Report`) to:
- Share common code among subclasses
- Enforce certain methods must be implemented by subclasses
- Provide a common base for polymorphic operations

### Why We Separated Concerns
Each component handles a specific responsibility:
- Easier to maintain and debug
- Multiple students can work simultaneously
- Changes in one component don't break others

---

## Common Issues and Solutions

### Issue: "Cannot find symbol" error
**Solution:** Make sure all classes are in the correct package and imported properly.

### Issue: NullPointerException
**Solution:** Always check if objects are null before using them.
```java
if (user != null) {
    user.displayInfo();
}
```

### Issue: Git merge conflicts
**Solution:** 
1. Pull latest changes: `git pull origin main`
2. Resolve conflicts in your editor
3. Test that everything still works
4. Commit and push

---

## Sample Usage

### Example Workflow: Student Enrolling in a Course

1. **Admin creates a course:**
   ```
   Admin Login → Manage Courses → Create Course
   Course Code: CS101
   Title: Intro to Programming
   Credits: 3
   Capacity: 30
   ```

2. **Student enrolls:**
   ```
   Student Login → View Available Courses → Select CS101 → Enroll
   System checks: Prerequisites? Capacity? Credit limit?
   Enrollment successful!
   Notification sent: "You are now enrolled in CS101"
   ```

3. **Instructor assigns grade:**
   ```
   Instructor Login → View My Courses → CS101 → Assign Grades
   Select Student → Enter Score: 85
   Grade calculated: B (3.0 GPA)
   Notification sent: "Your grade for CS101 has been posted"
   ```

4. **Student views transcript:**
   ```
   Student Login → Generate Transcript
   Course: CS101 | Grade: B | Credits: 3 | GPA: 3.0
   Overall GPA: 3.0
   ```

---

## Collaboration Guidelines

### Git Workflow
1. **Create a feature branch:**
   ```bash
   git checkout -b feature/user-management
   ```

2. **Make your changes and commit:**
   ```bash
   git add .
   git commit -m "Implemented Student class with GPA calculation"
   ```

3. **Push your branch:**
   ```bash
   git push origin feature/user-management
   ```

4. **Create Pull Request (optional):**
   - Go to GitHub
   - Click "Compare & pull request"
   - Wait for team review

5. **Merge to main:**
   ```bash
   git checkout main
   git merge feature/user-management
   git push origin main
   ```

### Communication
- **Daily standups:** Brief 10-minute meetings to sync progress
- **Code reviews:** Review each other's code before merging
- **Shared document:** Track who's working on what to avoid conflicts
