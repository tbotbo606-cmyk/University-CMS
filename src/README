# University Course Management System

A comprehensive console-based Java application for managing university operations, including users, courses, enrollments, grades, and reports. This project demonstrates core Object-Oriented Programming (OOP) principles: **Inheritance, Polymorphism, Encapsulation, and Abstraction**.

 Project Overview
This system allows:
- **Admins** to manage users, courses, and generate reports.
- **Instructors** to assign grades and view rosters.
- **Students** to enroll/drop courses and view transcripts.

It replaces traditional database systems with a custom **File-based Persistence System** using Java Serialization.

 Features
- **User Management**: Support for Students and Admins with specific roles.
- **Course Management**: Create, list, and validate courses.
- **Enrollment**: Enroll students with validation (Capacity, Prerequisites).
- **Grading**: Assign numerical scores and auto-calculate Letter Grades & GPA.
- **Notifications**: Simulate sending Emails and SMS upon key events.
- **Reports**: Generate dynamic Transcripts and Course Rosters.
- **Persistence**: All data is saved automatically to `.dat` files.

 OOP Principles Implemented

 1. Inheritance
We used inheritance to promote code reuse and establish hierarchical relationships:
- **Users**: `Student` and `Admin` classes inherit from the abstract base class `User`.
- **Reports**: `Transcript` and `CourseRoster` inherit from the abstract class `Report`.
- **Notifications**: `EmailNotification` and `SMSNotification` inherit from `Notification`.

 2. Polymorphism
We achieved polymorphism through method overriding and interfaces:
- **Notifications**: The `send()` method behaves differently for `EmailNotification` (prints email format) vs `SMSNotification` (prints short message), even when called from the same list.
- **Reporting**: The `generateReport()` method is overridden in each report subclass to format output specifically for that report type.
- **Service Interfaces**: `NotificationManager` implements `NotificationService`, allowing loose coupling.

 3. Encapsulation
Data integrity is maintained by:
- Marking all fields in models (`Student`, `Course`, `Grade`) as `private`.
- Providing public `getters` and `setters` with validation logic (e.g., GPA cannot be negative).
- Hiding the internal file handling logic within the `UniversityDataRepository`.

 4. Abstraction
Complexity is hidden using abstract classes and interfaces:
- **Interfaces**: `DataRepository`, `NotificationService`, `ReportGenerator` define *what* needs to be done without specifying *how*.
- **Abstract Classes**: `User` defines the template for a user but forces subclasses to implement `getRole()`.

How to Run
Prerequisites
Java Development Kit (JDK) 8 or higher.

Compilation
Navigate to the project root directory and run:
javac -d bin src/com/university/*.java src/com/university/models/*.java src/com/university/services/*.java src/com/university/repositories/*.java src/com/university/notifications/*.java src/com/university/reports/*.java
Execution
Run the compiled application:
java -cp bin com.university.Main

Usage Steps (Demo)
Login as Admin (Default: admin / admin123).

Select "Add New Course" to create a course (e.g., CS101).

Select "Add New User" to create a student.

Logout and login as the new Student.

Select "Enroll in Course" to register for CS101.

Login as Instructor/Admin to assign a grade.

Login as Student again to view the Transcript.

Data Persistence
The application uses Java Serialization to store data. Upon the first run, the following files are created in the project root:

users.dat

courses.dat

enrollments.dat

grades.dat
